# Module 2 Summary: Design Prompts for Everyday Work Tasks

## 🎯 Key Concept
Generative AI tools adapt to tone and style through **contextual understanding** and **user-driven prompts**. With the right instructions, these tools can match your desired communication style—be it professional, casual, persuasive, or academic.

## 🧠 How Gen AI Handles Tone & Style

### Contextual Understanding
AI tools interpret input based on:
- **Audience awareness**
- **Linguistic cues** (e.g., punctuation)
- **User preferences**
- **Reference examples**

These elements help determine the tone, style, and output, such as sounding like a friend or professor.

---

## 🛠️ Strategies to Match Tone & Style

### 1. **Specify Tone and Style**
Be clear in your prompt. Instead of:
> Summarize this report.

Use:
> Summarize this report in a friendly, professional, and easy-to-understand tone.

Get specific:
- "Witty banter" instead of "funny"
- "Like a professor" instead of just "academic"

### 2. **Provide References**
Include reference examples of tone and style:
> Consider the tone of interviews with top climbers.

This helps the AI better align with your expectations.

### 3. **Iterate & Refine**
If the output isn't quite right:
- Add more descriptive tone/style details
- Clarify emotional intent
- Adjust specificity until it feels right

> Always Be Iterating (ABI) — treat your prompt like a script for an actor!

## 🧩 Why This Matters

The right tone ensures your message is:
- **Understood** by the intended audience
- **Effective** in its purpose
- **Engaging** and clear

Prompting tone/style correctly = better communication with AI.

## 📝 Summarization Best Practices

To get better summaries:
- **Task**: Be specific (length, format, tone, audience)
- **Context**: Explain the purpose (e.g., team briefing)
- **References**: Add a sample summary if available
- **Evaluate**: Check the output for accuracy and relevance
- **Iterate**: Refine your prompt if needed

---

## 📏 Long Context Windows & Token Limits

Modern AI tools support more **tokens**, letting you input longer documents and still get meaningful summaries.

- **Tokens** = building blocks of AI language
- **Long context** = better memory in ongoing conversations
- Useful for PDFs, emails, data-heavy prompts, etc.

> Note: Context resets in new sessions unless retained in a thread.

---

## ✅ Final Tip

Treat AI like a smart assistant. Be clear, provide examples, iterate, and guide it toward your voice. The more context you give, the better the AI can perform.
