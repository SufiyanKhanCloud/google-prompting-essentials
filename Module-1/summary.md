## 🖼️ Introduction to Multimodal Prompting
- **Multimodal = using multiple input types (text, image, audio, etc.)**
- Examples:
  - Generate a poem using a sunset photo.
  - Describe a place using audio from your trip.
  - Create designs from brand logos and colors.
- Use cases: accessibility, storytelling, design, and more.

## 🧰 Using the Prompting Framework (Text + Multimodal)

**T - Task**  
Be clear about what you want and how each input (text, image, audio) should be used.

**C - Context**  
Provide relevant background and constraints.

**R - References**  
Add visuals, links, or audio to guide the output style or content.

**E - Evaluate**  
Review the results carefully. Multimodal outputs may require extra scrutiny.

**I - Iterate**  
Improve the prompt using one of these strategies:
- Break into smaller tasks
- Add constraints
- Rephrase
- Try a related approach

## 🧭 Tips for Responsible Prompting

### ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- AI can generate biased or false results. Always **review before using**.
- Keep a **human-in-the-loop**—you’re the final decision-maker.

### 💬 Combatting Bias & Stereotypes
- Use **inclusive language** (e.g., “foods from around the world”).
- If biased output appears, **point it out and refine your prompt**.
- Diversity improves both ethics and quality.

### 🧠 Handling AI Hallucinations
- **Hallucination** = false information.
- Use **clear inputs** and **fact-check** outputs.
- Try asking the same prompt in different ways or tools.

### 🔁 Dealing with Misunderstandings
- Avoid slang or unclear phrases (e.g., don’t say "think outside the box").
- Instead, use literal and precise language ("suggest creative solutions").
