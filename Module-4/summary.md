## 🔗 Prompt Chaining Basics

- Chain prompts by using the output of one as the input/context for the next.
- Improves clarity, structure, and quality in multi-step workflows.
- **Example Workflow**:
  1. Generate an outline
  2. Expand outline into sections
  3. Generate quiz based on content
  4. Create visual suggestions

## 🧠 Advanced Prompt Chaining Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Guides the AI to reason step-by-step
- Helps reduce hallucination and improve logical flow
- Prompt Example:  
  `"Break down your thinking step by step to answer the following..."`

### 2. Tree-of-Thought Prompting
- Generates multiple possible outputs (branches)
- Encourages exploration and comparison
- Great for: creative brainstorming, tone/style options

## 🧪 Meta-Prompting (Prompt Engineering with AI)

Use AI to generate or refine prompts:

### 🛠 Prompt Generation
- **Direct**:  
  `"Create a prompt to write a professional job offer letter."`
- **Template-based**:  
  `"Give me a reusable prompt template for trip planning."`
- **Reference-based**:  
  Use examples or documents to guide the prompt structure

### 🛠 Prompt Refinement
- **Improve tone**:  
  `"Make this prompt more persuasive/technical/humorous."`
- **Combine prompts**:  
  Merge two tasks into one cohesive prompt
- **Change style**:  
  `"Rewrite this in a more emotional tone."`

## 🤖 AI Agents: Role-Based Prompting

Create intelligent agents that follow specific instructions:

### Structure:
1. Define a Role  
   _e.g., “You are a negotiation coach”_
2. Set a Scenario  
   _e.g., “Help a user prepare for a salary negotiation”_
3. Add Dialogue Type  
   _e.g., back-and-forth guidance_
4. Specify Feedback Rules  
   _e.g., "Always give constructive advice"_

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

- Practice interviews or public speaking
- Get AI-based feedback on documents
- Brainstorm creative content
- Learn soft skills, languages, or even grant writing
